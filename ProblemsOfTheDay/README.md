# ProblemOfTheDay

## Problem of the day 1:
the solution to the problem of the day is that you compare the numbers a to b and b to c
if both conditions are true return the numbers are the same(equal) otherwise set a to the biggest and compare to b and c if one them is bigger than a set it as the bigger and return.

## Problem of the day 2:
in this problem the user enter the number of the vectors and then enters the coordinates of each vector (x1, y1) (x2, y2)
after that the program calculate each vector's length and slope and also find the min and max y coordinate out of all the y coordinates.

## Problem of The Day 3:
in this problem we check for the first non duplicate number in the array.

## Problem of The Day 4:
in this solution we find where the left sum of the array equals the right sum of the array if true print the two halvs of the array else print false
